# KronBot

## How to run the bot:</br>
To run the bot you need first to create a 
`tokenfile.py` in the bot root folder and add a `tokenID` variable wich has to be the token of the bot as string.</br>
For more info see the [official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2)

After the token file is set you can run the bot by using the command:</br>
```python3 main.py```
